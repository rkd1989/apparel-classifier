# Apparel Classifier (Minimal Prototype)

This repository contains a simple proof-of-concept script for classifying apparel using a deep learning model. The project demonstrates how to load a pre-trained image classification model and run inference on a single input image.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Loads a trained image classification model (e.g., TensorFlow `.h5` or PyTorch `.pth`)
- Accepts a single image input
- Outputs the predicted apparel class

```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkd1989/apparel-classifier.git
   cd apparel-classifier
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   *(Ensure you have Python and pip installed)*
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you create one
   ```

3. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> Modify the script to load your custom model and adjust preprocessing to fit your dataset.

## ✅ Use Cases

- Initial ML prototype for fashion or e-commerce projects
- Educational or experimental script to test image classification workflows

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Support for batch prediction
- Web interface using Streamlit or Flask
- Integration with a dataset and training script
